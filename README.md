Home Inventory managment system
In this project, we will build a home inventory manager program. This program lets you keep a
record of your belongings.
  The idea of the program is to enter and/or view descriptive information about each item in your
inventory. You can enter:
                   Inventory Item A description of the item (required)
                  Location Description of where item is located
                  Marked Indicates if item is marked with some kind of identifying
                  information (social security number, driverâ€™s license number,phone number)
                  Serial Number : Item serial number
                  Purchase Price : How much you paid for the item.
                  Date Purchased : When you purchased the item.
                  Store/Website : Where you purchased the item.
                  Note Any additional information about the item.
